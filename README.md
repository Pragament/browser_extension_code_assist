# Code Extractor Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that extracts code from web pages, injects a chat sidebar, and allows users to query the code using an AI model via a local API server.

## Overview

This project combines a Chrome extension with a Flask-based API server to provide an interactive code analysis tool. The extension extracts code from specified web pages (e.g., W3Schools try-it pages) and uses an AI model (e.g., TinyLLaMA) hosted via Ollama to respond to user prompts. Users can manage rules for code extraction and choose between a default Prompt API or a custom Python API.

## Features
- Extracts code from web pages based on user-defined URL patterns and CSS selectors.
- Injects a chat sidebar for interacting with extracted code.
- Supports two API modes: Prompt API (default local Ollama server) and Python API (custom URL).
- Manages rules via the options page.
- Integrates with Ollama for AI-powered code explanations.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**
- **Node.js** (for potential future enhancements, though not currently required)
- **Chrome Browser**
- **Ollama** (for running the AI model)
- **Git** (for version control, optional)
